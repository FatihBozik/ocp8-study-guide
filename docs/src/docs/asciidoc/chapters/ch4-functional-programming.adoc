== Functional Programming

=== Using Variables in Lambdas

Lambda expressions can access

- static variables,
- instance variables,
- final or effectively final method parameters and
- final or effectively final local variables.

[source,java]
----
interface Gorilla { String move();}
class GorillaFamily {
    String walk = "walk";
    void everyonePlay(boolean baby) {
        String approach = "amble";
        // approach = "run";
        play(() -> walk);
        play(() -> baby ? "hitch a ride" : "run");
        play(() -> approach);
    }
    void play(Gorilla g) {
        System.out.println(g.move());
    }
}
----

If we uncomment `// approach = "run"` line, there will be reassignment and when it tries to access non-effectively final variable.
The normal rules for access control still apply.
For example, a lambda can't access `private` variables in another class.

=== Working with Built-in Functional Interfaces

A functional interface has exactly one abstract method.
All of the functional interfaces in below table provided in the `java.util.function` package.

|===

Many other functional interfaces are defined in the `java.util.function` package.
They are working with primitives.

NOTE: There's an interface called `Runnable`.
It is used for concurrency the majority of the time. `Runnable` doesn't take any parameters, return any data, or use generics.

{empty} +


==== Implementing _Supplier_

A `Supplier` is used when you want to generate or supply values without taking any input.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<T> {
    public T get();
}
----

[source,java]
----
Supplier<LocalDate> s1 = LocalDate::now;
Supplier<LocalDate> s2 = () -> LocalDate.now();

LocalDate d1 = s1.get();
LocalDate d2 = s2.get();

System.out.println(d1); // 2020-03-29
System.out.println(d2); // 2020-03-29
----

The `LocalDate::now` method reference is used to create a `Supplier` to assign to an intermediate variable s1. A `Supplier` is often used to when constructing new objects.

[source,java]
----
Supplier<StringBuilder> s1 = StringBuilder::new;
Supplier<StringBuilder> s2 = () -> new StringBuilder();

System.out.println(s1.get());
System.out.println(s2.get());

Supplier<ArrayList<String>> s3 = ArrayList<String>::new; // ArrayList::new;
ArrayList<String> a1 = s3.get();
System.out.println(a1);
----

==== Implementing _Consumer_ and _BiConsumer_

You use a `Consumer` when you want to do something with parameter but not return anything. `BiConsumer` does the same thing except that it takes two parameters.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);

    // omitting default method
}
----

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiConsumer<T, U> {
    void accept(T t, U u);

    // omitting default method
}
----

{empty} +

NOTE: You'll notice this pattern.
_Bi_ means two, it comes from Latin.

{empty} +


[source,java]
----
Consumer<String> c1 = System.out::println;
Consumer<String> c2 = x -> System.out.println(x);

c1.accept("Annie"); // prints Annie
c2.accept("Annie"); // prints Annie
----

Java uses the context of the lambda to determine which overloaded `println()` method it should call.

`BiConsumer` is called with two parameters.
They don't have to be the same type.
For example, we can put a key and a value in a map using this interface.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
BiConsumer<String, Integer> bc1 = map::put;
BiConsumer<String, Integer> bc2 = (k, v) -> map.put(k, v);

bc1.accept("chicken", 7);
bc2.accept("chick", 1);

System.out.println(map); // prints {chicken=7, chick=1}
----

==== Implementing _Predicate_ and _BiPredicate_

`Predicate` is often used when filtering or matching.
Both are very common operations.
A `BiPredicate` is just like a `Predicate` except that it takes two parameters instead of one.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);

    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiPredicate<T, U> {
    boolean test(T t, U u);

    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

[source,java]
----
Predicate<String> p1 = String::isEmpty;
Predicate<String> p2 = x -> x.isEmpty();

System.out.println(p1.test("")); // prints true
System.out.println(p2.test("")); // prints true


BiPredicate<String, String> bp1 = String::startsWith;
BiPredicate<String, String> bp2 = (string, prefix) -> string.startsWith(prefix);

System.out.println(bp1.test("chicken", "chick")); // prints true
System.out.println(bp2.test("chicken", "chick")); // prints true
----

`startsWith` is an instance method.
This means that the first parameter in the lambda is used as the instance on which to call the method.
The second parameter is passed to the `startsWith` method itself.

.Default Methods on Functional Interfaces
****
By definition, all functional interfaces have a single abstract method.
This doesn't mean that they have only one method, though.
Several of the common functional interfaces provide number of helpful `default` methods.

Suppose that we have these two predicates.

[source,java]
----
Predicate<String> egg = s -> s.contains("egg");
Predicate<String> brown = s -> s.contains("brown");
----

Now we want a predicate for brown eggs and another for all other colors of eggs.
We could write this by hand:

[source,java]
----
Predicate<String> brownEggs = s -> s.contains("egg") && s.contains("brown");
Predicate<String> otherEggs = s -> s.contains("egg") && !s.contains("brown");
----

A better way to deal with this situation is to use two of the `default` methods on `Predicate`.

[source,java]
----
Predicate<String> brownEggs = egg.and(brown);
Predicate<String> otherEggs = egg.and(brown.negate());
----
****

==== Implementing _Function_ and _BiFunction_

A `Function` is responsible for turning one parameter into a value of a potentially different type and returning it.
Similarly, a `BiFunction` is responsible for turning two parameters ito a value and returning it.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);

    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiFunction<T, U, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u);

    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

For example, this function converts a `String` to the length of the String:

[source,java]
----
Function<String, Integer> f1 = String::length;
Function<String, Integer> f2 = s -> s.length();

System.out.println(f1.apply("cluck")); // prints 5
System.out.println(f2.apply("cluck")); // prints 5
----

The following combines two `String` objects and produces another `String`.

[source,java]
----
BiFunction<String, String, String> bf1 = String::concat;
BiFunction<String, String, String> bf2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(bf1.apply("baby ", "chick")); // prints baby chick
System.out.println(bf2.apply("baby ", "chick")); // prints baby chick
----

.Creating Your Own Functional Interfaces
****
Java provides a built-in interface for functions with one or two parameters.
What if you need more?
You could create a functional interface such as this:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface TriFunction<T, U, V, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u, V v);
}
----

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface QuadFunction<T, U, V, W, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u, V v, W w);
}
----
****

==== Implementing _UnaryOperator_ and _BinaryOperator_

`UnaryOperator` and `BinaryOperator` are a special case of a function.
They require all type parameters to be the same type.
An `UnaryOperator` transforms its value into one of the same type.
For example, incrementing by one is unary operator.
In fact, `UnaryOperator` extends `Function`.
A `BinaryOperator` merges two values into one of the same type.
Adding two numbers is a binary operation.
Similarly, `BinaryOperator` extends `BiFunction`.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T, T> {
    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BinaryOperator<T> extends BiFunction<T, T, T> {
    // omitting any default or static methods
}
----

If you look at the Javadoc, you'll notice that `apply` methods are actually declared on the `Function/BiFunction` superclass.
The generic declarations on the subclass are what force the type to be the same.

[source,java]
----
UnaryOperator<String> u1 = String::toUpperCase;
UnaryOperator<String> u2 = x -> x.toUpperCase();

System.out.println(u1.apply("chirp")); // prints CHIRP
System.out.println(u2.apply("chirp")); // prints CHIRP


BinaryOperator<String> b1 = String::concat;
BinaryOperator<String> b2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(b1.apply("baby ", "chick")); // prints baby chick
System.out.println(b2.apply("baby ", "chick")); // prints baby chick
----

=== Returning an _Optional_

An `Optional` is created using a factory.
You can either request an empty `Optional` or pass a value for the `Optional` to wrap.
Think of an `Optional` as a box that might have something in it or might instead be empty.

[source,java]
----
public class OptionalDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(average(90, 100)); // prints Optional[95.0]
        System.out.println(average());        // prints Optional.empty
    }

    public static Optional<Double> average(int... scores) {
        if (scores.length == 0) return Optional.empty();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int score : scores) sum += score;
        return Optional.of((double) sum / scores.length);
    }
}
----

You can see that one `Optional` contains a value and the other is empty.
Normally, we want to check if a value is there and/or get it out of the box.
Here's one way to do that:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Double> opt = average(90, 100);
if(opt.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println(opt.get()); // 95.0
}
----

What if we didn't do the check and the `Optional` was empty?

[source,java]
----
Optional<Double> opt = average();
System.out.println(opt.get()); // throws java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present
----

.`Optional` instance methods
[stripes=even,cols="3a, 5a, 5a",options="header"]
|===
|Method |When `Optional` is Empty |When `Optional` Contains a Value

|`get()`
|Throws an exception
|Returns value

|`ifPresent(Consumer c)`
|Does nothing
|Calls `Consumer c` with value

|`isPresent()`
|Returns `false`
|Returns `true`

|orElse(T other)
|Returns `other` parameter
|Returns value

|orElseGet(Supplier s)
|Returns result of calling `Supplier`
|Returns value

|orElseThrow(Supplier s)
|Throws exception created by calling `Supplier`
|Returns value
|===

You already seen `get()` and `isPresent()`.
The other methods allow you to write code that uses an `Optional` in one line without having to use the ternary operator.

[source,java]
----
Optional<Double> opt = average(90, 100);
opt.ifPresent(System.out::println); // 95.0
----

Using `ifPresent` better expresses our intent.
We want something done if a value is present.
The other methods allow you to specify what to do if a value isn't present.

[source,java]
----
Optional<Double> opt2 = average();
System.out.println(opt2.orElse(Double.NaN)); // NaN
System.out.println(opt2.orElseGet(() -> Math.random())); // 0.295228248010566
System.out.println(opt2.orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalStateException())); // throws java.lang.IllegalStateException
----

=== Using Streams

A _stream_ in Java is a sequence of data.
A _stream pipeline_ is the operations that run on a stream to produce a result.
There are three parts to a stream pipeline:

- _Source_: Where the stream comes from.
- _Intermediate operations_: Transforms the stream into another one.
There can be as few or as many intermediate operations as you'd like.
Since streams use lazy evaluation, the intermediate operations do not run util the terminal operation run.
- _Terminal operation_: Actually produces a result.
Since streams can be used only once, the stream is no longer valid after a terminal operation completes.

.Intermediate vs. terminal operations
[stripes=even,cols="3, 1, 1"]
|===
|Scenario |For Intermediate Operations? |For Terminal Operations?

|Required part of a useful pipeline?
|No
|Yes

|Can exist multiple times in a pipeline?
|Yes
|No

|Return type is a stream type?
|Yes
|No

|Executed upon method call?
|No
|Yes

|Stream valid after call?
|Yes
|No
|===

==== Creating Stream Sources

In Java, the `Stream` interface is in the `java.util.stream` package.
There are a few ways to create finite stream:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> empty = Stream.empty();          // count = 0
Stream<Integer> singleElement = Stream.of(1);   // count = 1;
Stream<Integer> fromArray = Stream.of(1, 2, 3); // count = 3;
----

Since streams are new in Java 8, most code that's already written uses lists.
Java provides a convenient way to convert from list to a stream.

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
Stream<String> fromList = list.stream(); // <1>
Stream<String> fromListParallel = list.parallelStream(); // <2>
----
<1> Simple method call to create a stream from list
<2> Creates stream that is allowed to process elements in parallel.

Just keep in mind that it isn't worth working in parallel for small streams.
There is overhead cost in coordinating the work among all of the workers operating in parallel.
For small amounts of work, it is faster just to do it sequentially.

We can't create an infinite list, though, which makes streams more powerful:

[source,java]
----
Stream<Double> randoms = Stream.generate(Math::random);
Stream<Integer> oddNumbers = Stream.iterate(1, n -> n + 2);
----

`Stream.generate(Math::random)` generates streams of random numbers.
If you call `randoms.forEach(System.out::println)`, the program will print random numbers until you kill it.

`iterate` takes a seed or starting value as the first parameter.
This is the first element that will be part of the stream.
The other parameter is lambda expression that get passed the previous value and generates the next value.

==== Using Common Terminal Operations

You can perform a terminal operation without any intermediate operations but not the other way around.
_Reductions_ are a special type of terminal operation where all of the contents of the stream are combined into a single primitive or `Object`.
For example, you might have an `int` or a `Collection`.

|`reduce()`
|Does not terminate
|Varies
|Yes
|===

===== _count()_

The `count()` method determines the number of elements in a finite stream.
For an infinite stream, it hangs. `count()` is a reduction because it looks at each element in the stream and returns a single value.
The method signature is this: `long count()`

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "gorilla", "bonobo");
System.out.println(s.count()); // prints 3
----

===== _min()_ and _max()_

The `min()` and `max()` methods allow you to pass a custom comparator and find the smallest or largest value in a finite stream according to that sort order.
Like `count()`, `min()` and `max()` hang on an infinite stream.
Both methods are reductions.
The method signatures are as follows:

[source,java]
----
Optional<T> min(Comparator<? super T> comparator);
Optional<T> max(Comparator<? super T> comparator);
----

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "ape", "bonobo");
Optional<String> min = s.min((s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
min.ifPresent(System.out::println); // ape
----

Notice that the code returns an `Optional` rather than the value.
This allows the method to specify that no minimum or maximum was found.

[source,java]
----
Optional<?> minEmpty = Stream.empty().min((s1, s2) -> 0);
System.out.println(minEmpty.isPresent()); // false
----

Since the stream is empty, the comparator is never called and no value is present in the `Optional`.

===== _findAny()_ and _findFirst()_

The `findAny()` and `findFirst()` methods return an element of the stream unless the stream is empty.
If the stream is empty, they return an empty `Optional`.
`findAny()` is useful when you are working with a parallel stream.
It gives Java the flexibility to return to you the first element it comes by rather than the one that needs to be first in the stream based on intermediate operations.

These methods are terminal operations but not reductions.
The reason is that they sometimes return without processing all of the elements.
This means that they return a value based on the stream but do not reduce the entire stream into one value.

The method signatures are these:

[source,java]
----
Optional<T> findAny();
Optional<T> findFirst();
----

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "gorilla", "bonobo");
s.findAny().ifPresent(System.out::println); // monkey

Stream<String> infinite = Stream.generate(() -> "chimp");
infinite.findAny().ifPresent(System.out::println); // chimp
----

Finding any one match is more useful than it sounds.
Sometimes we just want to sample the results and get a representative element, but we don't need to waste the processing generating them all.

===== _allMatch()_, _anyMatch()_ and _noneMatch()_

The _allMatch()_, _anyMatch()_ and _noneMatch()_ methods search a stream and return information about how the stream pertains to the predicate.
These may or may not terminate for infinite streams.
It depends on the data.
Like find methods, they are not reductions because they do not necessarily look at all of the elements.
The method signatures are as follows:

[source,java]
----
boolean anyMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
boolean allMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
boolean noneMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
----

This example checks whether animal names begin with letters.

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("monkey", "2", "chimp");
Predicate<String> beginsWithLetterPredicate = s -> Character.isLetter(s.charAt(0));
System.out.println(list.stream().anyMatch(beginsWithLetterPredicate)); // true
System.out.println(list.stream().allMatch(beginsWithLetterPredicate)); // false
System.out.println(list.stream().noneMatch(beginsWithLetterPredicate)); // false

Stream<String> infinite = Stream.generate(() -> "chimp");
System.out.println(infinite.anyMatch(beginsWithLetterPredicate)); // true
----

On the infinite list, one match is found, so the call terminates.
If we called `noneMatch()` or `allMatch()`, they would run until we killed the program.

NOTE: Remember that `allMatch()`, `anyMatch()` and `noneMatch()` return a `boolean`.
By contrast, the find methods return an `Optional` because they return an element of the stream.

===== _forEach()_

A looping construct is available.
As expected, calling `forEach()` on an infinite stream does not terminate.
Since there is no return value, it is not a reduction.

Before you use it, consider if another approach would be better.
For example, a loop with an if statement should be a filter instead.

[source,java]
----
void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action);
----

Notice that this is the only terminal operation with a return type of `void`.
If you wanted something to happen, you have to make it happen in loop.
Here's one way to print the elements in the stream.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "gorilla", "bonobo");
s.forEach(System.out::print); // monkeygorillabonobo
----

NOTE: Remember that you can call `forEach` directly on a `Collection` or on a `Stream`.
Don't get confused on the exam when you see both approaches.

Notice that you can't use a traditional for loop on a stream.

[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> s = Stream.of(1);
for (Integer i : s) { } // DOES NOT COMPILE
----

Streams cannot use a traditional for loop to run because they don't implement the `Iterable` interface.

===== _reduce()_

The `reduce()` method combines a stream into a single object.
As you can tell from the name, it is a reduction.

[source,java]
----
T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)

Optional<T> reduce(BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)

<U> U reduce(U identity, BiFunction<U, ? super T, U> accumulator, BinaryOperator<U> combiner)
----

The most common way of doing a reduction is to start with an initial value and keep merging it with the next value.

[source,java]
.Without Functional Programming
----
String[] array = new String[]{"w", "o", "l", "f"};
String result = "";
for (String s : array) result = result + s;
System.out.println(result); // wolf
----

The initial value of an empty `String` is the identity.
The accumulator combines the current result with the current `String`.
With lambdas, we can do the same thing with a stream and reduction:

[source,java]
.Functional Way
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
String word = stream.reduce("", (s, c) -> s + c);
System.out.println(word); // wolf
----

Notice how we still have the empty `String` as identity.
We also still concatenate the `Strings` to get the next value.
We can even rewrite this with a method reference:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
String word = stream.reduce("", String::concat);
System.out.println(word); // wolf
----

Write a reduction to multiply all of the `Integer` objects in a stream?

[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> streamOfInteger = Stream.of(3, 5, 6);
System.out.println(streamOfInteger.reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b)); // 90
----

In many cases, the identity isn't really necessary, so Java lets us omit it.
When you don't specify an identity, an `Optional` is returned because there might not be any data.
There are three choices for what in the `Optional`:

- If the stream is empty, an empty `Optional` is returned.
- If the stream has one element, it is returned.
- If the stream has multiple elements, the accumulator is applied to combine them.

[source,java]
----
BinaryOperator<Integer> multiplication = (a, b) -> a * b;
Stream<Integer> empty = Stream.empty();
empty.reduce(multiplication).ifPresent(System.out::println); // No output

Stream<Integer> oneElement = Stream.of(3);
oneElement.reduce(multiplication).ifPresent(System.out::println); // 3

Stream<Integer> threeElements = Stream.of(3, 5, 6);
threeElements.reduce(multiplication).ifPresent(System.out::println); // 90
----

The third method signature is used when we are processing collections in parallel.
It allows Java to create immediate reductions and then combine them at the end.

[source,java]
----
BinaryOperator<Integer> op = (a, b) -> a * b;
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(3, 5, 6);
System.out.println(threeElements.reduce(1, op, op)); // 90
----

===== _collect()_

The `collect()` method is a special type of reduction called a _mutable reduction_.
It is more efficient than a regular reduction because we use the same mutable object while accumulating.
Common mutable objects include `StringBuilder` and `ArrayList`.
This is a really useful method, because it lets us get data out of streams and into another form.
The method signatures are as follows:

[source,java]
----
<R> R collect(Supplier<R> supplier, BiConsumer<R, ? super T> accumulator, BiConsumer<R, R> combiner)

<R, A> collect(Collector<? super T, A, R> collector)
----

Our wolf example from `reduce` can be converted to use `collect()`:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
StringBuilder word = stream.collect(StringBuilder::new, StringBuilder::append, StringBuilder::append);
System.out.println(word); // wolf
----

The first parameter is a `Supplier` that creates the object that will store the results as we collect data.
Remember that a `Supplier` doesn't take any parameters and returns a value.
In this case, it constructs a new `StringBuilder`.

The second parameter is a `BiConsumer`, which takes two parameters and doesn't return anything.
It is responsible for adding one more element to the data collection.
In this example, it appends the next `String` to the `StringBuilder`.

The final parameter is another `BiConsumer`.
It is responsible for taking two data collections and merging them.
This is useful when we are processing in parallel.
Two smaller collections formed and then merged into one.
This would work with `StringBuilder` only we didn't care about the order of the letters.
In this case, the accumulator and combiner have similar logic.

Now let's look at an example where the logic is different in the accumulator and combiner:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
TreeSet<String> set = stream.collect(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add, TreeSet::addAll);
System.out.println(set); // [f, l, o, w]
----

The collector has three parts as before.
The supplier creates an empty `TreeSet`.
The accumulator adds a single `String` from the `Stream` to the `TreeSet`.
The combiner adds all of the elements of one `TreeSet` to another in case the operations were done in parallel and need to be merged.

In practice, there are many common collectors that come up over and over.
Rather than making developers keep reimplementing the same ones, Java provides an interface with common collectors.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
TreeSet<String> set = stream.collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));
System.out.println(set); // [f, l, o, w]
----

If we didn't need the set to be sorted, we could make the code even shorter:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f");
Set<String> set = stream.collect(Collectors.toSet());
System.out.println(set); // [f, w, l, o]
----

You might get different output for this last one since `toSet()` makes no guarantees as to which implementation of `Set` you'll get.
It is likely to be a `HashSet`, but you shouldn't expect or rely on that.

==== Using Common Intermediate Operations

Unlike a terminal operation, intermediate operations deal with infinite streams simply by returning an infinite stream.
Since elements are produced only as needed, this works fine.

===== _filter()_

The `filter()` method returns a `Stream` with elements that match a given expression.
Here is the method signature:

[source,java]
----
Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
----

This operation is easy to remember and very powerful because we can pass any `Predicate` to it.
For example, this filters all elements that begin with the letter _m_:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "gorilla", "bonobo");
s.filter(t -> t.startsWith("m")).forEach(System.out::println); // monkey
----

===== _distinct()_

The `distinct()` method returns a stream with duplicate values removed.
The duplicates do not need to be adjacent to be removed.
As you might imagine, Java calls `equals()` to determine the objects are the same.
The method signature is as follows:

[source,java]
----
Stream<T> distinct()
----

Example:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("duck", "duck", "duck", "goose");
s.distinct().forEach(System.out::print); // duckgoose
----

===== _limit()_ and _skip()_

The `limit()` and `skip()` methods make a `Stream` smaller.
They could make a finite stream smaller, or they could male a finite stream out of an infinite stream.
The method signatures are shown here:

[source,java]
----
Stream<T> limit(int maxSize)

Stream<T> skip(int n)
----

Example:

The following code creates an infinite stream of numbers counting from 1. The skip operation returns an infinite stream starting with the numbers counting from 6i since it skips the first five elements.
The `limit()` call takes the first two of those.

[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> s = Stream.iterate(1, n -> n + 1);
s.skip(5).limit(2).forEach(System.out::print); // 67
----

===== _map()_

The `map()` method creates a one-to-one mapping from the elements in the stream to the elements of the next step in the stream.
The method signatıre is as follows:

[source,java]
----
<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper)
----

NOTE: The `map()` method on streams is for transforming data.
Don't confuse it with the `Map` interface, which maps keys to values.

As an example, this code converts a list of `String` objects to a list of `Integer` representing their lengths:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("monkey", "gorilla", "bonobo");
s.map(String::length).forEach(System.out::print); // 676
----

Remember that `String::length` is shorthand for the lambda `x -> x.length()`, which clearly shows it is a function that turns a `String` into an `Integer`.

===== _flatMap()_

The _flatMap()_ method takes each elements in the stream and makes any elements iy contains top-level elements in a single stream.
This is helpful when you want to remove empty elements from a stream or you want to combine a stream of lists.

[source,java]
----
<R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Stream<? extends R>> mapper)
----

This gets all of the animals into the same level along with getting rid of the empty list:

[source,java]
----
List<String> zero = Arrays.asList();
List<String> one = Arrays.asList("Bonobo");
List<String> two = Arrays.asList("Mama Gorilla", "Baby Gorilla");
Stream<List<String>> animals = Stream.of(zero, one, two);

animals.flatMap(l -> l.stream()).forEach(System.out::println);
----

Here's the output:

Bonobo {empty} +
Mama Gorilla {empty} +
Baby Gorilla

As you can see, it removed the empty list completely and changed all elements of each list to be at the top level of the stream.

===== _sorted()_

The `sorted()` method returns a stream with the elements sorted.
Just like sorting arrays, Java uses natural ordering unless we specify a comparator.
The method signatures are these:

[source,java]
----
Stream<T> sorted()

Stream<T> sorted(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
----

Calling the first signature uses the default sort order:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("brown-", "bear-");
s.sorted().forEach(System.out::print); // bear-brown-
----

Remember that we can pass a lambda expression as the comparator.
We can pass a `Comparator` implementation:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> s = Stream.of("brown bear-", "grizzly-");
s.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).forEach(System.out::print); // bear-brown-grizzly-brown bear-
----

Do you see why this doesn't compile?

[source,java]
----
s.sorted(Comparator::reversedOrder); // DOES NOT COMPILE
----

The `Comparator` interface implements one method that takes two `String` parameters and returns an `int`.
However, `Comparator::reverseOrder` doesn't do that.

===== _peek()_

The `peek()` method is useful for debugging because it allows us to perform a stream operation without actually changing the stream.

[source]
----
Stream<T> peek(Consumer<? super T> action)
----

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("black bear", "brown bear", "grizzly");
long count = stream.filter(e -> e.startsWith("g")).peek(System.out::println).count(); // grizzly
System.out.println(count); // 1
----

NOTE: When working with a `Queue`, `peek()` looks only at the first element.
In a stream, `peek()` looks at each element that goes though that part of the stream pipeline.
It's like having a worker take notes on how a particular step of the process is doing.

.Danger: Changing State with _peek()_
****
Remember that `peek()` is intended to perform an operation without changing the result.

[source,java]
----
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
List<Character> letters = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(1);
letters.add('a');
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
Stream<List<?>> good = Stream.of(numbers, letters);
good.peek(l -> builder.append(l)).map(List::size).forEach(System.out::print); // 11
System.out.println(builder); // [1][a]
----

In this example, you can see that `peek()` updates a `StringBuilder` variable that doesn't affect the result of the stream pipeline.
It prints 11. Java doesn't prevent us from writing bad peek code.

[source,java]
----
Stream<List<?>> bad = Stream.of(numbers, letters);
bad.peek(l -> l.remove(0)).map(List::size).forEach(System.out::print); // 00
----

This example is bad because `peek()` is modifying the data structure that is used in the stream, which causes the result of the stream pipeline to be different than if the peek wasn't present.

****

==== Putting Together the Pipeline

Streams allow you to use chaining and express what you want to accomplish rather than how to do so.
Let's say that we wanted to get the first two names alphabetically that are four characters long.

.In Java 7
[source,java]
----
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Toby", "Anna", "Leroy", "Alex");
List<String> filtered = new ArrayList<>();
for (String name : list) {
    if (name.length() == 4) filtered.add(name);
}
Collections.sort(filtered);
Iterator<String> iter = filtered.iterator();
if(iter.hasNext()) System.out.println(iter.next());
if(iter.hasNext()) System.out.println(iter.next());
----

.Java 8 equivalent
[source,java]
----
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Toby", "Anna", "Leroy", "Alex");
list.stream().filter(n -> n.length() == 4)
              .sorted()
              .limit(2)
              .forEach(System.out::println);
----

The difference is that we express what is going on.
We care about `String` objects of length 4. Then we want them sorted.
Then we want to first two.
Then we want to print them out.

[source,java]
----
Stream.generate(() -> "Elsa")
                .filter(n -> n.length() == 4)
                .sorted()
                .limit(2)
                .forEach(System.out::println);
----

It actually hangs until you kill the program or it throws an exception after running out of memory.
The foreman has instructed sorted() to wait until everything to sort is present.
That never happens because there is an infinite stream.
What about this example?

[source,java]
----
Stream.generate(() -> "Elsa")
                .filter(n -> n.length() == 4)
                .limit(2)
                .sorted()
                .forEach(System.out::println);
----

This one prints `Elsa` twice.
The filter lets elements through and `limit()` stops the earlier operations after two elements.
Now `sorted()` can sort because we have a finite list.
Finally, what do you think this does?

[source,java]
----
Stream.generate(() -> "Olaf Lazisson")
            .filter(n -> n.length() == 4)
            .limit(2)
            .sorted()
            .forEach(System.out::println);
----

This one hangs as well until we kill the program.
The filter doesn’t allow anything through, so `limit()` never sees two elements.

=== Working with Primitives

Up until now, we have been using wrapper classes when we needed primitives to go into streams.
With streams, there are also equivalents that work with the `int`, `double`, and `long` primitives.
Suppose that we want to calculate to the sum of numbers in finite stream:

[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
int reduce = stream.reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b); // 6
----

There is another way of doing that.

[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
System.out.println(stream.mapToInt(x -> x).sum()); // <1>
----
<1> We converted our `Stream<Integer>` to an `IntStream` and asked the `InStream` to calculate for sum for us.
The primitive streams know how to perform certain common operations automatically.

How you would compute an average*

[source,java]
----
IntStream intStream = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3);
OptionalDouble avg = intStream.average();
System.out.println(avg.getAsDouble());
----

Not only is it possible to calculate the average, but it is also easy to do so.o

==== Creating Primitive Streams

- `InStream`: Used for the primitive types for `int`, `short`, `byte`, and `char`.
- `LongStream`: Used for the primitive type `long`.
- `DoubleStream`: used for the primitive types `double` and `float`.

You can create an empty stream with this:

[source,java]
----
DoubleStream empty = DoubleStream.empty();
----

Another way is to use the `of()` factory method from a single value or by using the `varargs` overload:

[source,java]
----
DoubleStream oneValue = DoubleStream.of(3.14);
oneValue.forEach(System.out::println);

DoubleStream varargs = DoubleStream.of(1.0, 1.1, 1.2);
varargs.forEach(System.out::println);
----

It works the same way for each type of primitive streams.
You can also use this approach for creating stream:

[source,java]
----
DoubleStream random = DoubleStream.generate(Math::random);
random.limit(3).forEach(System.out::println);

DoubleStream fractions = DoubleStream.iterate(.5, d -> d / 2);
fractions.limit(3).forEach(System.out::println);
----

`Random` class provides a method to get primitive streams of random numbers directly.
For example, `ints()` generates an infinite stream of `int` primitives.

[source,java]
----
Random r = new Random();
r.ints().limit(3).forEach(System.out::println); // 123
----

When dealing with `int` or `long` primitives, it is common to count.
Suppose that we wanted a stream with the numbers from 1 through 5.

[source,java]
----
IntStream count = IntStream.iterate(1, n -> n + 1).limit(5);
count.forEach(System.out::println); // 12345

IntStream range = IntStream.range(1, 6);
range.forEach(System.out::println); // 12345

IntStream rangeClosed = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
rangeClosed.forEach(System.out::println); // 12345
----

The final way to create a primitive stream is by mapping from another stream type.

.Mapping methods between types of streams
[stripes=even,cols="2a, 2a, 2a, 2a, 2a",options="header"]
|===
|Source Stream Class |To Create Stream |To Create `DoubleStream` |To Create `IntStream` |To Create `LongStream`

|`Stream`
|`map`

|`mapToObj`
|`mapToDouble`
|`map`
|`mapToLong`

|`LongStream`
|`mapToObj`
|`mapToDouble`
|`mapToInt`
|`map`
|===

Java requires a mapping function to be provided as a parameter, for example:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> objStream = Stream.of("penguin", "fish");
IntStream intStream = objStream.mapToInt(s -> s.length());
----

This function that takes an `Object`, which is a `String` in this case.
The function returns an `int`.

NOTE: You can also create a primitive stream from a Stream using `flatMapToInt()`, `flatMapToDouble()`, `flatMapToLong()`.
For example: {empty} +
      `IntStream ints = list.stream().flatMapToInt(x -> IntStream.of(x));`

==== Using _Optional_ with Primitive Streams

[source,java]
----
IntStream stream = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10);
OptionalDouble optional = stream.average();
----

`OptionalDouble` is for a primitive and `Optional<Double`> is for the `Double` wrapper class.
Working with the primitive optional class looks similar to working with the `Optional` class itself.

[source,java]
----
optional.ifPresent(System.out::println);
System.out.println(optional.getAsDouble());
System.out.println(optional.orElseGet(() -> Double.NaN));
----

The only noticeable difference is that we called `getAsDouble()` rather than `get()`
This makes it clear that we are working with primitive.
Also, `orElseGet()` takes a `DoubleSupplier` instead of `Supplier`.

.Optional types for primitives
[stripes=even,cols="2a, 2a, 2a, 2a",options="header"]
|===
| |`OptionalDouble` |`OptionalInt` |`OptionalLong`

|`OptionalInt`
|`OptionalLong`

|Return type of `sum()`
|double
|int
|long

|Return type of `average()`
|OptionalDouble
|OptionalDouble

|===

Let's try an example:

[source,java]
----
LongStream longs = LongStream.of(5, 10);
long sum = longs.sum();
System.out.println(sum); // 15

DoubleStream doubles = DoubleStream.generate(() -> Math.PI);
OptionalDouble min = doubles.min(); // runs infinitely
----

==== Summarizing Statistics

[source,java]
----
private static int range(IntStream ints) {
    IntSummaryStatistics stats = ints.summaryStatistics();
    if (stats.getCount() == 0) throw new RuntimeException();
    return stats.getMax() - stats.getMin();
}
----

- Generics are gone from some of the interfaces, since the type name tells us what primitive type is involved.
In other cases, such as `IntFunction`, only return type generic is needed.
- The single abstract method is often, but not always, renamed to reflect the primitive type involved.
- `BiConsumer`, `BiPredicate`, and `BiFunction` are not in above table.
The API designers stuck to the most common operations.
For primitives, the functions with two different tyep parameters just aren't used often.

In addition, some interfaces are specific to primitives.

=== Working with Advanced Stream Pipeline Concepts

==== Linking Streams to the Underlying Data

[source,java]
----
List<String> cats = new ArrayList<>();
cats.add("Annie");
cats.add("Ripley");
Stream<String> stream = cats.stream();
cats.add("KC");
System.out.println(stream.count());
----

The correct answer is 3. `cats.stream()` requests that a stream be created from that `List`.
Remember that streams are lazily evaluated.
This means that the stream isn't actually created this point.
An object is created that knows where to look for the data when it is needed.
`count()` method called , the stream pipeline actually runs.
The stream pipeline runs first, looking at the source and seeing three elements.

==== Chaining Optionals

Suppose that you are given an `Optional<Integer>` and asked to print the value, but only if it is a three-digit number.
Without functional programming, you could write the following:

[source,java]
----
private static void threeDigit(Optional<Integer> optional) {
    if (optional.isPresent()) {
        Integer num = optional.get();
        String string = "" + num;
        if (string.length() == 3)
            System.out.println(string);
    }
}
----

Let's try this again with functional programing.

[source,java]
----
private static void threeDigit(Optional<Integer> optional) {
    optional.map(n -> "" + n)
            .filter(s -> s.length() == 3)
            .ifPresent(System.out::println);
}
----

Now suppose that we wanted to get an `Optional<Integer>` representing the length of the `String` contained another Optional.
Easy enough:

[source,java]
----
Optional<String> optional = Optional.of("Animal");
Optional<Integer> integer = optional.map(String::length);
integer.ifPresent(System.out::println);
----

What if we had a helper method that did the logic of calculating something for us and it had the signature `static Optional<Integer> calculator(String s)` ?
Using map doesn't work.

[source,java]
----
public class ChainingOptionals {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Optional<Integer> result = optional.map(Example3::calculator); // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }

    private static Optional<Integer> calculator(String s) {
        return Optional.of(5);
    }
}
----

The problem is that calculator returns `Optional<Integer>`.
The `map()` method adds another `Optional`, giving us `Optional<Optional<Integer>>`.
The solution is to call `flatMap()` instead:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Integer> result = optional.flatMap(Example3::calculator);
----

`flatMap` removes the unnecessary layer.
In other words, it flattens result.
Chaining calls to `flatMap()` is useful when you want to transform one `Optional` type to another.

.Checked Exceptions and Functional Interfaces
****
The functional interfaces do not declare checked exceptions.
It is a problem when working with methods that declare checked exceptions.
Suppose that we have a class with a method that throws a checked exception:

[source,java]
----
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class ExceptionCaseStudy {
    private static List<String> create() throws IOException {
        throw new IOException();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        create().stream().count(); // DOES NOT COMPILE> unhandled exception
    }
}
----

The `create()` method throws a checked exception.
The calling method handles or declares it.
What about this one?

[source,java]
----
Supplier<List<String>> s = ExceptionCaseStudy::create; // DOES NOT COMPILE> unhandled exception
----

The problem is that the lambda to which this method reference expands does declare an exception.
`Supplier` interface does not allow checked exceptions.
There are two approaches to get around this problem.
One is catch the exception and turn it an unchecked exception.

[source,java]
----
Supplier<List<String>> s = () -> {
    try {
        return Example4.create();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
};
----

Another alternative is to create a wrapper method with the `try/catch`:

[source,java]
----
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class ExceptionCaseStudy {
     private static List<String> createSafe() {
        try {
            return Example4.create();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
    }
    private static List<String> create() throws IOException {
        throw new IOException();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Supplier<List<String>> s2 = Example4::createSafe;
    }
}
----

****

===== Collecting Using Basic Collectors

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
String result = ohMy.collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
System.out.println(result); // lions, tigers, bears
----

We pass the predefined `joining()` collector to the `collect()` method.
All elements of the stream are then merged into a `String` with the specified delimeter between each element.

What is the average length of the three animal names?

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Double result = ohMy.collect(Collectors.averagingInt(String::length));
System.out.println(result); // 5.333333333333333
----

The pattern is the same.
We pass a collector to `collect()` and it performs the average for us.
This time, we needed to pass a function to tell the collector what to average.
We used a method reference, which returns an `int` upon execution.
With primitive streams, the result of an average was always a `double`, regardless of what type is being averaged.
For collectors, it is a `Double` since those need an `Object`.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy3 = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
TreeSet<String> result3 = ohMy3.filter(s -> s.startsWith("t"))
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));
System.out.println(result3); // [tigers]
----

`Stream.of()` is the source for the stream.
Intermediate operation is `filter()`.
Finally, the terminal operation is `collect()`, which creates a `TreeSet`.

===== Collecting into Maps

Let's start out with a straightforward example to create a map from a stream:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<String, Integer> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s, String::length));
System.out.println(map); // {lions=5, bears=5, tigers=6}
----

When creating a map, you need to specify two functions.
The first function tells the collector how to create the key.
In our example, we use the provided `String` as the key.
The second function tells the collector how to create the value.
In our example, we use the length of the `String` as the value.

Returning the same value passed into a lambda is a common operation, so Java provides a method for it.
You can rewrite `s -> s` as `Function.identity()`.
It is not shorter and may or may not be clearer, so use your judgement on whether to use it.

Now we want to do the reverse and map the length of the animal name to the name itself.
Our first incorrect attempt is shown here:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, String> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.toMap(String::length, k -> k)); // throws java.lang.IllegalStateException: Duplicate key lions
----

Running this gives an IllegalStateException.
Two of the animal names are the same length.
We didn't tell Java what to do.
Should the collector choose the first one it encounters?
The last one it encounters?
Concatenate the two?
Since collector has no idea what to do.

Let's suppose that our requirement is to create a comma-separated `String` with the animal names.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, String> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.toMap(String::length, k -> k, (s1, s2) -> s1 + "," + s2));
System.out.println(map); // {5=lions,bears, 6=tigers}
System.out.println(map.getClass()); // class java.util.HashMap
----

It so happens that the `Map` returned is a `HashMap`.
This behaviour is not guaranteed.
Suppose that we want to mandate that code return a `TreeMap` instead.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, String> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.toMap(String::length, k -> k, (s1, s2) -> s1 + "," + s2, TreeMap::new));
System.out.println(map); // {5=lions,bears, 6=tigers}
System.out.println(map.getClass()); // class java.util.TreeMap
----

===== Collecting using Grouping, Partitioning, and Mapping

Now suppose that we want to get groups of names by their length.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, List<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length));
System.out.println(map); // {5=[lions, bears], 6=[tigers]}
----

The `groupingBy` collector tells `collect()` that it should group all of the elements of the stream into lists, organizing them by the function provided.
This makes the keys in the map function value and the values the function results.

Suppose that we don't want a `List` as the value in map and prefer a `Set` instead.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, Set<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.toSet()));
System.out.println(map); // {5=[lions, bears], 6=[tigers]}
----

We can even change the type of Map returned through yet another parameter:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
TreeMap<Integer, Set<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, TreeMap::new, Collectors.toSet()));
System.out.println(map); // {5=[lions, bears], 6=[tigers]}
----

What if we want to change the type of the Map returned but leave the type of values alone as `List`?

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
TreeMap<Integer, List<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, TreeMap::new, Collectors.toList()));
System.out.println(map); // {5=[lions, bears], 6=[tigers]}
----

Partitioning is a special case of grouping.
With partitioning, there are only two posiible groups - true and false.
_Partitioning_ is like splitting a list into two parts.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Boolean, List<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.length() <= 5));
System.out.println(map); // {false=[tigers], true=[lions, bears]}

Stream<String> ohMy2 = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Boolean, List<String>> map2 = ohMy2.collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.length() <= 7));
System.out.println(map2); // {false=[], true=[lions, tigers, bears]}
----

.Debugging Complicated Generics
****
When working with `collect()`, there are often many levels of generics, making compiler errors unreadable.

- Start over with a simple statement and keeping adding to it.
By making one tiny change at time, you will know which code introduced the error.
- Extract parts of the statement into separate statements.
For example, try writing `Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.counting());`.
If it compiles, you know that the problem lies everywhere.
If it doesn't compile, you have a much shorter statement to troubleshoot.
- Use generic wildcards for the return type of the final statement, for example, `Map<?, ?>`.
If that change alone allows the code to compile, you'll know that the problem lies with the return type not being what you expect.
****

As with `groupingBy()`, we can change the type of `List` to something else:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Boolean, Set<String>> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.length() <= 7, Collectors.toSet()));
System.out.println(map); // {false=[], true=[lions, tigers, bears]}
----

Unlike `groupingBy()`, we cannot change the type of Map that gets returned.
However, there are only two keys in the map, so does it really matter which `Map` type we use?

We can group by the length of the animal name to see how many of each length we have:

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, Long> map = ohMy.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.counting()));
System.out.println(map); // {5=2, 6=1}
----

Finally, there is a `mapping()` collector that lets us go down a level and add another collector.
Suppose that we wanted to get the first letter of the first animal alphabetically of each length.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears");
Map<Integer, Optional<Character>> map = ohMy.collect(
        Collectors.groupingBy(
                String::length,
                Collectors.mapping(s -> s.charAt(0), Collectors.minBy(Character::compareTo))
        )
);
System.out.println(map); // {5=Optional[b], 6=Optional[t]}
----
